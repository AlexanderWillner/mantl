# Steps to test a branch

Currently workflow is:

1. All jobs are tied to the particular GitHUB branch and tenant.
2. It has two types of jobs:

    - triggered by **PR (pull request)** to the particular branch
    - triggered by **commit** to the particular branch

3. These triggers automate the whole testing process.
4. We're using following naming template for jobs:

    - **View** reflects the particular tenant which was used for deployment process, it gathers all jobs tied to this tenant.
    - Trigger type - **COMMIT** for commit trigger, job can be started manually, **PR** for pull request trigger, job can't be started manually.
    - Branch name which is being tested by job, e.g. **master** or **qa-integration**
    - QA Tenant name where job is restricted to run, e.g. **CCS-MI-US-INTERNAL-1-QA-1**
    - Job named as **destroy** destroys cluster in the given tenant. This job starts as a madnatory post-build step of deploying job. This job could be started manually.

So you get the main idea of job naming conventions.

# Steps to check if Master branch failed or not (and all test runs)

Job which are triggered by commit to the particular branch can be started manually on demand.

Job is configurable an pretty flexible and it has the next main steps:

1.     Grabs the code base from GitHub
2.     Configures tenant
3.     Deploys configured cluster and run smoke tests
4.     Runs automated tests (robot-framework) (in case cluster is successfully deployed and smoke testing is done)
5.     Gathers reports, console logs
6.     Destroys cluster

To start test deployment the next few steps have to be done:

1.     Open a particular view with tenant to test cluster deployment
2.     Choose which branch you want run deployment for test
3.     Start testing by pushing "Play" button

# Steps to check issues (if any) during last (current) test

Status of job:

- Green ball all seems well, last one build was tested with no issues found
- Red ball something went wrong with last build, status is build failed
- Blinking/Fading build is in queue for run or job is running

Open job you want to check (click on the particular link with job name), so you can see status of job.

# Steps to see tests of all pull requests to mater branch and see any issues

All builds runs can be found in job build history pane.

Each build has two reports:

- console log which has been taken during the deploy
- robot-framework testing report

All reports are viewable in case of performed steps and results.

Pull request is triggered and starts running by cronjob, it polls GitHub every 5 min.

Each build has pull request information - number and link to GitHub, so status of testing each PR can be found easily.

After job build is done it updates status of GitHub pull request.

# Robot-framework automated testing

Each job performs after deployment automated testing, gathers and publish reports which is accessible from the Jenkins CI job run page.
The following components and features are covered by automated testing:

##### Core Components and Features

- [x] Mesos
	* verify HTML respond on port :5050
	* verify state :5050/state.json
	* verify status :5050/stats.json
- [x] Consul
	* verify if consul service is up and running on each host
	* get catalog/services list
	* verify catalog/services if status is "passing"  
- [ ] Multi-datacenter
- [ ] High availablity
- [ ] Rapid immutable deployment (with Terraform + Packer)

##### Mesos Frameworks

- [x] Marathon
	* create test app "sleep 3600" using REST API
	* verify app status using REST API
	* delete app using REST API
- [ ] Kubernetes
- [x] Kafka
	* create/start Kafka brokers
	* create/verify if Kafka Topic is created
	* send/receive/verify messages in Kafka Topic created above
- [ ] Riak
- [ ] Cassandra
- [ ] Elasticsearch
- [x] HDFS
	* upload file to each HDFS
	* remove file from each HDFS
- [x] Spark
	* runs testing code shown below using scala
	```
	val data = 1 to 10000
	val distData = sc.parallelize(data)
	val filteredData = distData.filter(_< 10)
	filteredData.collect()
	```
	* save above results using hdfs storage
	* runs Spark Pi example and verify result
- [ ] Storm
- [ ] Chronos
- [x] Logstash
	* verify if collectd service is up and running on each host

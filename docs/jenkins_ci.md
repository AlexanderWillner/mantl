Steps to test a branch

Current workflow is the following:

    1. All jobs are tied to the particular GitHUB branch and tenant:
    It has two types of jobs:

    2. triggered by PR (pull request) to the particular branch
    triggered by commit to the particular branch

    3. Mentioned triggers are automate all testing process.
    All jobs has the naming template shown below:



    1. View reflects the particular tenant which used for deployment process, gather all jobs tied to this tenant.
    2. Branch name which job controls, e.g. master
    3. Trigger type - provision for commit trigger, job can be started manually, pr-provision for PR trigger, job mustn't be started manually.
    4. Tenant name where job is restricted to run, e.g. CCS-MI-US-INTERNAL-1-QA-1
    5. Job which destroys cluster in the tenant, it starts always as post build step of deploying job, job can be started manually.

  So you get the main idea of job naming.

Steps to check if Master branch failed or not (and all test runs)

  Job which are triggered by commit to the particular branch can be started manually on demand.

  Job is configurable and flexible, it has the next main steps:

    1. Grabs the code base from GitHUB
    2. Configures tenant
    3. Deploys configured cluster and run smoke testing
    4. Runs automated tests (robot-framework) in case we have successfully deployed cluster
    5. Gathers reports
    6. Destroys cluster

To start test deployment the next few steps have to be done:

    1. Open the particular view with tenant to test cluster deployment
    2. Choose which branch you want test
    3. Start testing by pushing the button play

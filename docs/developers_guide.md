# Git development workflow

## Basic branches and purposes

* master: main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state for CORE services
* features-master: main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state for none CORE services
* qa-features-master-integration: source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. Some would call this the “integration branch”. This is where any automatic nightly builds are built from.

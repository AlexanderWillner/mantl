# Overview

The components that make up the packaging framework are:
 * [asteris-packaging](https://github.com/asteris-llc/asteris-packaging) - a docker image with scripts included to compile/package mesos and calico inside a docker container
 * [roles/packaging](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/microservices-infrastructure/tree/tool/packaging/roles/packaging/templates) - templates for marathon tasks that run `asteris-packaging` docker container
 * [group_vars/all/packaging.yml](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/microservices-infrastructure/blob/tool/packaging/group_vars/all/packaging.yml) - mostly bintray variable to be passed to build environments

### Flow
1. `ansible-packaging` docker image is run as marathon task
2. Inside container apropriate repo is cloned, bootstrap and packaging scripts are run
3. Bintray script is run, packages are uploaded
4. Marathon task is terminated from within container
